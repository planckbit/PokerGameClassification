This poker game program is an old college school project that was done back in the day for Windows using 
Microsoft Visual C++. I finally got sometime to dust off the floppy disk where this program has sat for at least 2 decades.
Having an old 3.5inch floppy drive with a USB interface I copied it over to my Linux machine and got it compiled for Linux. 

Enjoy!

To compile do:

ex:
g++ -o poker.bin -I/home/planckbit/Development/Poker/include poker.cpp cards.cpp classify.cpp


Current binary was compiled using:
g++ --version
g++ (Ubuntu 7.4.0-1ubuntu1~18.04.1) 7.4.0

Output when poker.bin executed:
